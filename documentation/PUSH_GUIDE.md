## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Remote already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/asl-translator.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Authentication Issues
If using HTTPS, you may need a Personal Access Token:
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select scopes: `repo` (all)
4. Use token as password when pushing

### Or Use SSH Instead
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH keys → New SSH key
# Copy your public key:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/asl-translator.git
git push -u origin main
```
