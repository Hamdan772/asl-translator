## 🚀 What's New in This Release

### Multi-Modal Recognition (4 Layers)
```
Layer 1: Finger State Detection
  └─ 4-method voting for thumb
  └─ Angle + distance for other fingers

Layer 2: Neural Network (396 features)
  └─ 63 landmarks + 5 finger states + 4 geometric + 324 HOG

Layer 3: Rule-Based Correction
  └─ V vs W auto-correction based on finger count

Layer 4: Confidence Scoring
  └─ Ambiguity detection
  └─ Stability bonus
```

### Enhanced Features
- **Debug Mode**: Toggle with D key for troubleshooting
- **Better Photo Capture**: Hand-only cropping with validation
- **Finger Pattern Matcher**: Advanced matching system (src/finger_matcher.py)
- **Improved Thumb Detection**: 4-condition voting system
- **Smart Corrections**: Auto-fixes V↔W confusion
- **Better Training**: Captures finger states, photos, and geometry

### Code Quality
- **Clean codebase**: No errors or warnings
- **Proper error handling**: Try-catch blocks with detailed messages

## 🎯 Model Status

### Current: UNTRAINED MODEL ⚠️
This release contains:
- ✅ Complete recognition system
- ✅ Training infrastructure
- ✅ All algorithms implemented
- ❌ NO trained model

### Why Untrained?
- Users can train for their specific hand shapes
- Different camera setups need different models
- Allows customization for individual needs

### How to Train
1. Run: `python3 src/asl_translator.py`
2. Press **T** for training mode
3. Train 3-5 letters with 15-20 samples each
4. Press **M** to train model
5. Test recognition!

## 🔜 Coming Soon

### Next Release: Pre-Trained Model
- Complete A-Z training
- 20+ samples per letter
- Tested and validated
- Ready to use out of the box

### Future Enhancements
- Dynamic gesture recognition (moving signs)
- Multi-hand support
- Word recognition (not just letters)
- Improved thumb detection
- Real-time confidence graphs
- Training progress indicators
