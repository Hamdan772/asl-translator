# DISABLED RULE-BASED CLASSIFIER - October 22, 2025

## ✅ What Was Changed

### Rule-Based Letter Recognition: DISABLED

The app was showing letters because it had TWO recognition systems:
1. **Rule-based classifier** (geometric patterns) ❌ **NOW DISABLED**
2. **ML classifier** (your training) ✅ **ONLY THIS WORKS NOW**

## Before vs After

### BEFORE:
```
Hand detected → Rule-based classifier → Shows letters (A, B, C, etc.)
                     ↓
                ML classifier (optional)
```
**Result**: Letters always shown, even without training

### AFTER:
```
Hand detected → ML classifier ONLY → Shows letters IF trained
```
**Result**: NO letters shown until YOU train the model!

## What This Means

### ✅ NOW:
- **No letters detected** until you train the model
- Hand tracking still works (you see dots)
- Learning mode still works (Press 'T')
- You can capture and label gestures
- ONLY after training (Press 'B' or 'M') will letters appear

### ❌ DISABLED:
- Pre-programmed letter recognition (all 24 letters)
- Geometric pattern matching
- Rule-based A, B, C, D, etc. detection

## How to Use Now

### 1. Start the App
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### 2. You'll See:
- ✅ Hand tracking with dots
- ❌ NO letters detected (blank/no recognition)
- This is CORRECT! No model trained yet

### 3. Train Your Model:
```bash
Press 'T' → Learning mode
Make gesture → Hold still → Type letter + ENTER
Repeat 10-15 times per letter
Press 'B' → Bulk train with outlier removal
```

### 4. After Training:
- ✅ NOW letters will be detected
- ✅ Using YOUR hand's training data
- ✅ Personalized to YOUR gestures

## Summary

**The app is now a BLANK SLATE:**
- Hand tracking: ✅ Works
- Letter detection: ❌ Disabled (until you train)
- Your training: ✅ Required for recognition
- No pre-programmed letters: ✅ All removed

**This is exactly what you asked for!** 🎉

Train the model yourself to see letter recognition!
